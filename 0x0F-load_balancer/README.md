 Foundations - Higher-level programming ― Python

## General

```
Ever wonder how Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter and other web giants are handling such huge amounts of traffic? They don’t have just one server, but tens of thousands of them. In order to achieve this, web traffic needs to be distributed to these servers, and that is the role of a load-balancer.

Advantages of load balancing your application:

- Reduced the work-load on an individual server.
- Large amount of work done in same time due to concurrency.
- Increased performance of your application because of faster response.
- No single point of failure. In a load balanced environment, if a server crashes the application is still up and served by the other servers in the cluster.
- When appropriate load balancing algorithm is used, it brings optimal and efficient utilization of the resources, as it eliminates the scenario of some server’s resources are getting used than others.
- Scalability: We can increase or decrease the number of servers on the fly without bringing down the application
- Load balancing increases the reliability of your enterprise application
- Increased security as the physical servers and IPs are abstract in certain cases.

```

## Tasks

0. Double the number of webservers
1. Install your load balancer
2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet
